Build
-----

The Web Service Facade is build with modules:

 core - contains the core service, the 'platform'
 test-harness - is a convenience module to help test the service 

wsfacade is built using Maven::
  
  mvn clean install -Pall to build all of the modules
  mvn clean install -Pcore builds just the core service into a deployable WAR

Additional build profiles are documented in the root `pom.xml`:pom.xml ::
  
  more pom.xml
